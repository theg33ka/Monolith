/// <summary>
///     Phase M: a "matcher" groups multiple entity prototypes into a single logical
///     catalog entry / contract target. Lets the YAML author express "any bread-like item" or
///     "any basic ingot" as one listing row with a custom name/description/sprite, instead of
///     enumerating a dozen separate entries.
///     Usage in YAML:
///     - type: ncMatcher
///     id: NcMatcherBreadLike
///     name: "Хлебобулочное"
///     description: "Любой хлеб, булки, рогалики"
///     sprite:
///     sprite: Objects/Consumable/Food/Baked/bread.rsi
///     state: plain
///     items:                  # strict list of prototype IDs
///     - FoodBreadLoaf
///     - FoodBreadBaguette
///     Semantics:
///     - items — used for EVERY spawn context (Buy-listings, Hunt-targets, spawn-delivery)
///     AND for match-checking brought items.
///     A matcher used in a spawn context must have at least one item in <see cref="Items" />.
///     Tag matching is represented by PrototypeMatchMode.Tag and standalone ncTradeTag targets.
